# Calendar Booking System

This is a modular calendar booking system built using **Java 21**, **Spring Boot**, and **Maven**.  
It allows multiple **calendar owners** to set their daily availability and lets **invitees** book 60-minute appointments without time conflicts.

---

## Features

- Calendar owners can define availability using fixed start and end times.
- Invitees can search for open 60-minute time slots.
- Appointment booking enforces:
  - No double booking
  - No booking in the past
  - Only valid 60-min time slots
- Retrieve all upcoming appointments or appointments by a specific date.

---

## Assumptions

- One Calendar per Owner: Each owner can set only one availability window (per day) and it applies to all future dates.

- Fixed Slot Duration: All appointments are exactly 60 minutes long and aligned on the hour (e.g., 10:00, 11:00).

- No Overlapping Appointments: A time slot becomes unavailable immediately after it is booked by an invitee.

- No Backdated Bookings: Appointments cannot be booked for a past date or time.

- Email as Primary ID: All users (owners or invitees) are identified by their email.

- In-Memory Storage: No database is used; all appointments and availability are stored in-memory using repository pattern.

- Stateless APIs: Each API request is independent and uses ownerEmail in the URL to operate on the correct calendar.

## Design Patterns & Architecture

- Repository Pattern

- Keeping core logic in Service Interfaces and Implementations

- Using Controller Layer for all RESTful endpoints

- Centralized Exception Handling

- DTOs for API Contracts

- Open/Closed Principle

## Tech Stack

- Java 21
- Spring Boot (Web, Validation)
- Springdoc OpenAPI for Swagger
- JUnit 5 + AssertJ + Hamcrest for testing
- Maven for build
